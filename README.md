Python File Organizer:
This Python script is a File Organizer that automatically categorizes files into different folders based on their file types. It helps keep your directories clean and well-organized by sorting files into predefined categories such as images, documents, audio, video, and more.

Features:
1: Automatic File Sorting: The script moves files into folders based on their file extensions (e.g., .jpg goes into the "Images" folder, .pdf into "Documents").
2: Customizable Folders: You can modify the folder categories or add new ones to suit your needs.
3: Batch Processing: Handles multiple files at once, efficiently organizing a cluttered directory.
4: Simple and Lightweight: Easy to use with minimal dependencies, designed to run locally on any directory.
5: Cross-platform Compatibility: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

How It Works:
1: The script scans the target directory for files.
2: It categorizes each file based on its extension (e.g., .jpg, .txt, .mp3) and moves them into corresponding folders.
3: If a folder for the file type does not exist, the script will create it.
4: Unrecognized file types are placed in a general "Others" folder.
